# achievements listed here
# format: "basename,maxval,hasformat"
#  basename: the base name used to construct cvars and localization strings
#  maxval: limit progress value (if any), a value of -1 means it needs special
#          handling in zscript (usually for cases where this is dynamic, like
#          the "all collectibles" achievement)
#  hasformat: the TXT string has a %d in it to substitute for maxval
#  gametype: the game this belongs to (any, doom, heretic, hexen, raven, etc.)
