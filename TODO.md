**Finishing touches before release:**

 - Collectibles

**Extra things after release:**

 - DLC weaponset
 - Additional collectibles not added due to time constraints
 - Additional achievements
 - Switchable grenade types
 - Extra shell/rocket types
 - "White Lady" rare LÃ¤mp spawn
 - More intermission art (shamefully e-begging on Twitter as usual orz)
 - Extra localizations (including Japanese)
 - Mod trailer video (doubt I'd be able to, I might ask someone instead)
 - Rewrite the entire Demolitionist Menu code from the ground up to be more easily extensible and adapt to any window size
 - Hexen key and puzzle item models?
 - DLC gameset

**Very extra things for the future:**

 - Saya and Ibuki companion add-ons (potentially a Kirin companion too)
 - Possibly also playable versions of them, for coop
 - Modeled Monster/Decoration replacers for all IWADs done in the style of the mod (will be very time consuming)
