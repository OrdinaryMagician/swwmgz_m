  - [7] Blackfire Igniter *(UnSX 5, Ultra Suite 3)*
  - [8] Rail Carbine *("Tesla Beamer" in Ultra Suite 2 & 3)*
  - [9] Ray-Khom *(UnSX)*
* ***(Maybe)* Add the collectibles that were removed due to time constraints:**
  - The Black Rat's Coven - Walpurgisnacht *(Debut album)*
  - Cat Catcher *(Promo poster)*
  - Hege Cactus *(Appears to absorb all water, causing intense thirst)*
  - Raidemin Action Figure *(A popular Nukuri superhero, "looks a lot like you")*
  - Hoagie *(Can't eat it, but looks delicious)*
  - Lithium - Volume One *(A work of art, one of the finest graphic novels)*
  - PISS Whiskey *("Is it actually piss or is that just the brand name? Either way, I don't want to know what's inside")*
  - **[Heretic]** Doomguy Action Figure *("Oh, he gets one too?")*
  - **[Hexen]** Obelisk of the Golden Vale *("I puked out my guts when I touched that fucking thing")*

  - ... maybe other small games
  - **[Doom]** Demo Land Adventure (platformer with shooty gameplay)
  - **[Heretic]** Interstellar Demolitionist (a somewhat simple SHMUP, kinda Touhou styled)
