**Nuutek** was founded by **Aranai Raikishionen** in 1945 BC, as a company dedicated to constructing weaponry for the **Yathai Empire**. They were pioneers in the introduction of "futuristic" alternatives to military technology of the era. Specifically, their research in weaponizing plasma. Not much changed for them in a long time, staying in the lead of the market for centuries, always innovating, thinking bigger, feeding more into the endless wars that ravaged **Nahkami**, hoping that one day the vile empire that had overthrown the Raikishionen family would be destroyed by the weapons they had created.

Things changed in 1744, with the fledgling **Nekuratek** entering the scene, and quickly becoming their main competitor. The two companies raced to surpass one another, but soon enough they were defeated, Nekuratek had become the empire's favorite, and through this grew so fast it was now impossible to beat. In an interview, **Raik L Raikishionen**, CEO at the time, admitted his company's defeat, stating that **"their plans are far more devious than we could ever imagine, they deserve to lead us into a new era"**. Interpretations of this statement vary, but following the fall of the empire in 2104, it was made clear that they too knew of Nekuratek's final goal.

Since then, the company has shifted their efforts to the manufacture of electronic components, many of which are used in products developed by Nekuratek. Their former weapon tech is discontinued, but it has all been open sourced and anyone with the right materials can build them if they want.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfWhew, plasma weapons that far back. The Nukuri sure were ahead of us by A WHOLE LOT. I mean, they just casually traveled from another galaxy to our Moon and built their own research station there back when humans were like... still only just figuring out iron. On top of that, they even saw through the fucking barrier to the Lunar Capital. Like, what the fuck, man.\c-

\cfOK, let's not get sidetracked. I pretty much have no contact with anyone from there, Zana-sama did all of that herself, so whatever we get from them goes though her first. Plasma guns are fun, and we get to play around with one of their flagship "blasters". Hope it's as face-melting as it sounds.\c-
