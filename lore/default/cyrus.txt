The personal tech company of **Reubens C. Karnanaiahmani**, acting mayor of the town of **Kereshnovka**, representative of all the **Qurensniv** people on Earth, and also second son of king **Marc P. Karnanaiahmani**. Reubens runs the whole thing all by himself, having no actual employees.

Cyrus is mainly focused on bringing highly advanced Qurensniv technology to humans. Among the company's most notable creations, there's **Hammerspaceâ„¢**, a method of "offworld storage" which allows individuals to travel light, needing only to carry a small device to store and deploy any objects they need at will. Many comments have been made on the rather "nerdy" naming of the company's various products, this being one of them.

In reference to the man himself, Reubens is well known for not only being a cunning inventor, but also an expert in hand to hand combat, being a ten times **Ko-Ron-Jai** (Qurensniv martial arts) champion, and also an excellent sharpshooter, able to land a hit on the head of a matchstick from 1km away with a mere revolver (this last fact hasn't yet been confirmed, however). He's also an avid gamer, and is often noted to draw comparisons between real life and videogames, to a worrying degree at times.

Cyrus Enterprises, furthermore, is the current main backer of the **Demolitionist** program, providing the required equipment for their missions, and personally paying for every hostile target the Demolitionist takes down, among other things.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfHe's a nerd, NEEEEEEEERD, BIG STINKIN' NERD!\c-

\cfThere, I said it. Like, sure, the stuff he makes, cool and all, but GOOD LORD the guy pisses me off with his stupid videogamey nerdy crap. Not letting you go in fully armed and instead deciding to fucking YEET your shit all over the place for you to pick up? That's one thing. Deciding that after every mission you have to RETURN all the stuff you got, that's another, too. Dropping some cash every time you blow up baddies, that I can accept, though, helps cover the costs of everything.\c-

\cfYou know, he may get on my nerves sometimes, but the guy was the first serious business partner I ever had, and damn, he's not that bad outside of all the nerditude he expels... I mean, to be honest, I'm also a big stinky nerd too, and you can quote me on that.\c-
