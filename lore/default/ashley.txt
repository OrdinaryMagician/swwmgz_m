Born in London in 1887, to **Yrikha Yanikov** and **Maxwell A. Knox**, **Ashley** is the oldest of three children, the others being **Adrian Knox**, veteran of both WW1 and WW2, and **Viola Knox**, a witch in training (still as of 2148). She spent most of her childhood in Cornwall, after her mother had to flee due to accusations of witchcraft (which weren't exactly false).

In 1983, she married **Fredrik Steiner**, the two having a single child, **Christopher Knox**, in 1989. However, after finding out she was a witch he immediately divorced her, leaving her raising her son all by herself. Despite the hardships they faced, Christopher grew up to become one of the greatest scientific prodigies of the early 21st century.

Ashley didn't really stick out much until the early 2000's, when, after many years of training to become a guitarist, she formed her own band with a group of friends (some she had met during her time also studying witchcraft in the offworld magical city of **Sankaideriha**).

Her band, **The Black Rat's Coven**, made its debut in 2006, initially composed of **Ashley**, **Py Kisun** (her brother's girlfriend), **William Dusk** (Ashley's boyfriend at the time), and, quite notably, the goddess of madness **Maruku Sarahabinaku**, whom Ashley had somehow managed to befriend. Together they became well known for their very peculiar style, blending the harsh guitars and drums of heavy metal with more classical instruments like the violin and harpsichord, or even in some cases, a full-on pipe organ, which Maruku has shown to be impressively skilled at playing in unconventional ways. Some have taken to define the type of music the band makes as a new genre entirely, aptly named **"Baroque Metal"**.

In 2027, following some undisclosed incident between her and William, the two broke up, and he left the band. Not content with just leaving, he decided to cause further harm by announcing that he had been cheating on her with her own granddaughter, **Lyra Knox**. William was replaced by **Mykka Psyann**, the goddess of lore.

Months after her breakup, during a concert in Japan, Ashley met **Yui Miyamoto**, an avid fan of the band for many years. The two began dating shortly after and, the next year, got married. As Ashley declared during an interview, she regretted not having noticed sooner that she's much happier with women.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfAhhhhhh man... Bless this lesbian, amen.\c- \cg♥\c-

\cfSeriously tho, Ashley-san is just amazing af, I love her music, I love her... everything. And fucking hell I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOO jealous of Yu-chan, she gets to enjoy those soft witch tiddies anytime she wants, while I have to ask for hugs and sometimes she says no and... fuck. But come on, it's just a hug damn it, I just want to feel the softness™, what's wrong with that?\c-

\cfAnyway, horniness aside, the other peeps from her band, cool too, really. Good friends with all of them, heck, even the huge one, that Maruku gal. Well, she barely talks and looks a bit scary... but is actually really nice, and one hell of a chuuni. And Mykka... ho boi, all fucking charm. I actually learned most of what I know about gods and stuff from her. She's always happy to talk for hours and hours about "lore", and shows me really cool things she can do with her powers too (she can make candy appear out of nowhere, good shit).\c-

\cfAnd last, in the case of Py, the smol pink girl... We're kinda maybe not really in very good terms because of some dumb comments I made which I honestly regret. Look, in my defense, I had no idea and I'm really REALLY blunt with the shit I say sometimes, I can't help it. And yes, sometimes I may casually ask someone who I find hot to "send nudes" or whatever but... ah, damn it all.\c-

\cfYes, I'm in her list of "undesirables who have asked for dick pics".\c-
