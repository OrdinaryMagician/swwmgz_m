A delicacy of Akkouxhei cuisine, **Milk Breads** as they are commonly called by the locals are a soft, sugary pastry typically eaten during special events, such as birthdays or weddings. Soft, fluffy buns of sweet bread enhanced with the refined sap of the native **Yranakha** trees and mixed with condensed **Gray Beast** milk, they melt in the mouth with each bite, becoming increasingly sweeter.

Though it is not generally a problem for the native **Anarukon**, the obscene sugar content of these has proven to be dangerous to mortals unless consumed in moderation, potentially resulting in the development of cardiovascular diseases or even death.

Nevertheless, they are quite popular around the world. Many visit the **Sykhai Empire** solely to have a chance at eating them, and may even stay for more. It is even said that they might be one of the secrets behind the nation's rapid growth.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYou know, learning that the milk comes from THOSE THINGS has absolutely not changed at all my opinion. This stuff is heavenly, it's the most delicious thing ever created, it's so sweet I'd just die for them. I mean, it kinda happened once when I overdosed on them (good god that was embarrassing). Yeah, no wonder I fucking died when I had more sugar than blood in my body. Kirin-kun said he actually heard my heart explode, but I bet he was just being dramatic, there's no way that's what happened.\c-

\cfOh yeah, and there's a myth going around that if you eat enough of these your boobs will get huge. I totally don't believe that's possible, of course not. What kind of fool would purposefully overdose on them to grow a pair of real big honkers?\c-
