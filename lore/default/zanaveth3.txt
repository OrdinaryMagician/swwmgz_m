**Zanaveth Nekuraku III** is the sole daughter of **Zanaveth Nekuraku II** and **Misa Azadeku Unissix**. She spent most of her early childhood on Earth, where she was born, though her and her family had to move back to **Nahkami** once she turned four, since by law, she had to study at a Nukuri school. It was in school that the young child began to have notable issues.

Zanaveth III was a frequent victim of bullying by her classmates, due to her odd personality and mannerisms, this was further intensified due to the effects of her Yikazoroi (lit. "Stress Burst"), a disorder prevalent among Nukuri children (though only developed by 1 in 200), which caused the constant bullying to eventually result in violent outbursts, which then further intensified the bullying. Due to the inaction of the school staff at the time, her mother sued them, and she had to be moved to a different school across the province.

In the wake of the **Nukuri Seventh World War**, Zanaveth III and her parents fled temporarily to **Sankaideriha**, aided by a friend of the Nekuraku family. During their stay there, it would be noted that their child had difficulty settling in, citing that being there gave her "mind shock". A formal diagnosis noted that she was reacting negatively to the natural flux of magic within the island, and it was suggested that she stayed with someone else, outside the island. The two eventually would put Zanaveth III in the care of **Saya Miyamoto**, a friend her mother had made during her first visit to Earth.

Zanaveth III stayed on Earth with Saya until the flames of war spread there, with the **White Scar** incident. Due to the Nukuri expulsion, she had to return to Nahkami and live with her grandparents. Her parents wouldn't be able to reunite with her until 2104, when the war finally ended.

In 2120, Zanaveth III enrolled in the **University of Nos-Kora**, taking on the very difficult course of **Pancake Engineering**, which she successfully finished 20 years later. After this, she announced the beginning of her "plan for world domination".

During her stay on Earth, Zanaveth III has had quite a noteworthy history on social media and online forums, arising from her strange personal dialect of English and nonsensical ramblings. Saya Miyamoto has come to label her as **Chuunibyou**, an old Japanese term used to denote the kind of traits she shows, such as the noted self-importance and desire to stand out, along with pretending to have special powers / possess arcane knowledge, and other fanciful sentiments.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfLil' chuuni Zana-chan. Sure, she may look cold and distant and antisocial and stuff, but that really can be blamed on how shit people have been to her. God I wish I could just beat up all of her bullies. I remember how she'd often come to me crying, all angry and frustrated after getting into trouble and I'd just sit her down on my lap and give her headpats and hugs. Ahhhhh... really made me feel like a mommy right there.\c-

\cfI miss that stuff, I really do. Petting that soft fluffy blue hair of hers. Wish I knew what she's up to now, that whole thing of "world domination" totally does sound like her thing wwwww\c-

\cfWell, if she comes here to Earth I'd welcome my new chuuni overlord with open arms.\c-

During a moment of confusion immediately after the demonic invasion of 2148, Zanaveth III made her appearance on Earth, setting forth a rather nonsensical plan for world domination, which backfired due to internal conflicts with one of her "henchmen". Following this defeat, she managed to evade the authorities for some time, hiding at the **Akari Labs** headquarters, but had to eventually return to Nahkami.

\cfAh, my precious little chuuni. It was such a surprise to see her pop up at my place out of nowhere like that, gave me a good scare. But there we were once again, reunited like in the old times. She was covered in bruises and burns and her makeup was all over the place from crying, poor thing. I gave her lots of hugs and pets, all she needed. Even went and gave her a bath like when she was little, hehehe.\c-

\cfOh yeah, and also that thing. Yeah, I hope she keeps that a secret from Zana-sama. I may have um... well, I "gave her a hand", if you know what I mean. I thought it'd help her cheer up a bit, as silly as the idea was, but she liked it, huhuhu...\c-

\cfAnd then just like that, she left again, *sigh*\c-
