Built in secrecy by **Qurensniv** members of the **Faculty of Illuminated Nobodies**, a doomsday cult that dates back millions of years into the past, **SUSAN** is an AI-controlled megastructure a dozen kilometers tall (though most of it is underwater). Its construction was finalized in 2018, and was then immediately activated, after which it began its mission to "purify the world" by hijacking Russia's nuclear missile systems (since they were the closest), then over time spreading its control further, reaching other major countries with nuclear weaponry. By the start of 2019 it had already assumed control of all nukes in the entire planet, and a broadcast began, announcing a countdown of three years before all weapons were armed and detonated in unison, bringing forth "World Purification".

Many attempts were made to stop this rogue AI, but all failed. Its main structure, located off the coast of **Kereshnovka** proved impenetrable, and any who approached would be swiftly eliminated by its weapons. It was clear that destroying it directly was an impossibility, but some suggested an alternative: Finding a way to "counter-hack" it. In mid-2020, a group of the world's most skilled hackers finally neutralized the AI, completely overtaking it. They were so successful, in fact, that they even managed to install various operating systems and programs freely, as it appeared to be based on the same architecture as any standard desktop computer. During many months, people celebrated, having prevented the extinction of all of mankind.

After some analysis of files found in SUSAN, the masterminds behind this doomsday device could be tracked down and brought to justice: Doctor **Daniel Perkman**, a senior IT engineer at **Imanaki Corp**; **Hiroshi Yuramaki**, Dr. Perkman's assistant and **Umbrelle N. Owen** (assumed name), current lead of the Qurensniv branch of the FIN. During questioning, Ms. Owen managed to escape, and days later, SUSAN was rebooted and resumed its countdown, but this time, its internal security had been hardened, and all hope was lost for it to be stopped again.

Earth could do nothing but stand in wait, watching the digits of the countdown drop, one by one, with the estimated "purification" being set for August of 2021. With only mere months left, there were mass panics, whole cities up in flames, it was chaos. But then, in February of 2021, something unexpected would happen: The **Luna Event**.

A broadcast was sent from somewhere in the Moon. It was not of human origin, and it overtook all radio and television ranges. The **Nukuri** were announcing their presence, having watched and studied us for countless years. They had remained neutral to all of our various conflicts, but this time they had seen that we were unable to overcome the upcoming disaster, so they would break their vow of non-intervention there and then. Only moments after the broadcast, in an instant, SUSAN was shut down completely, being struck by a blinding flash of light from above. It was clear that this alien race far surpassed us, if they could get rid of it that easily.

It was determined that truly destroying SUSAN would be excessively dangerous for the planet, so it merely remained there, as a massive piece of useless junk drifting around the Arctic Sea. Dismantling it could also be an option, but it would prove too expensive and time consuming of an ordeal.

In 2097, long after the events of **World War 3** and the **White Scar**, with the Nukuri race no longer allied to us and available to defend us, an unidentified alien entity arrived on Earth. A large, floating humanoid figure, clad in white robes and with the appearance of an old man, who announced himself to be **God**. Many had a hard time believing such a thing, but others were quick to acknowledge that this was definitely the Abrahamic God himself descending onto Earth from the Heavens. \cf[ed. note: bunch of idiots is what they are]\c-

After making his presence known all across the world, he then approached the deactivated SUSAN structure, and entered it. Those expecting that it would be destroyed were the ones most shocked by what happened next: It was reactivated, and once again resumed all its operations, this time with a much shorter countdown of two years. The words of the godly entity now resonated all over the world. Mankind had proven to be unworthy of walking the Earth, and it was his wish to undo it all, to wipe the planet and start anew, from a clean slate. We had previously interrupted his will, conducted through his most faithful followers, but this time he would not allow that to happen again. Those were his words, and once again, all went back to chaos.

Wounded by the previous war, and now having voluntarily discarded all their technological advances of Nukuri origin, along with cutting all contact with them, there was no chance to fight back. In the last moments of the countdown, the whole world was ready to accept death. What came at the end of this countdown was, however, not that, but something else entirely.

With a roaring shockwave that cleared the skies of the whole planet, a massive explosion erupted from atop SUSAN, expelling large pieces of its internal machinery into space. The cause of this explosion was unknown, but it happened just in time to prevent a much bigger disaster. Many days later, the charred remains of the alien entity were retrieved from the ruins of the megastructure. Many studies would be conducted on the biology of what was assumed to be a dead god.

Religious groups all over the world condemned what was seen as "the murder of God" \cf[ed. note: these fucking people...]\c-, but they were all eventually silenced. In a post on social media, **Maruku Sarahabinaku**, pianist of **The Black Rat's Coven** stated that "the dead one is not one of us", in response to an article on his autopsy. Questioned about the exact meaning of their response, Maruku would go on to reveal everything about his true nature. The "false god" was a man named **Uruk'Anth**, and came from the **Xevetha** race, who were infamous for their attempts to "achieve artificial godhood", furthermore, they added that if people wanted to see an actual god, "you could have just talked to me".

The reveal of Maruku Sarahabinaku as being an actual deity was followed by that of another member of the band, drummer **Mykka Psyann**. She remarked on actually having known Uruk'Anth, back when he was "a servant of the tyrant god". Confusion and disbelief would intermix for a long time, but all eventually settled on accepting what had been said by these two individuals.

SUSAN was finally dismantled in 2130 by the **Union Aerospace Corporation**, who would go on to study its various components for potential "beneficial applications".

Even though these events have all long passed, everyone remembers. The story of these incidents had not only shown us how easily and quickly all we had ever done could be destroyed, but also came with its two major revelations, one being that we are not alone in the universe, that many alien races exist out there, some peaceful, some hostile; and the other, that gods are more real and truer than anyone could have thought, and that some live among us, without us having ever realized.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfBig one, this article, huh? All this stuff happened waaaay back before you were even born, Demo-chan, but I thought it'd be good that you read up on it.\c-

\cfIt's a pretty crazy story, I know, but it all happened. Don't really remember a lot of it, personally, it was veeeery long ago, heh. I do remember though that one thing, that when they hacked the big ol' machine, they put a fucking Minecraft server on it, and it could host a shitton of players without a hitch. They also tried running Crysis, and when they noticed that it ran too smoothly, they started 29 more instances of it, and it still kept being silky smooth. God that was such a fucking mess (and the MC server was still running btw).\c-

\cfAnyway, won't rant more about things you're too young to understand. So yeah, this fucking thing came up and wanted to destroy us all, but with all that we learned that the Nukuri were there, and it was good, and then I met Zana-sama and we became friends, and all that... which obviously got fucking undone by the White Scar (ugh).\c-

\cfAnd yeah, gods. Fucking... GODS. Real damn gods. I actually already knew those two from Ashley-san's band, so yeah, was also quick to have my doubts about that old geezer. Dude just pops up from nowhere looking like a stereotypical "god of christianity" and everything. Come on, that's just too fucking obvious.\c-

\cfPS: Taro is currently seething in his seat. He can't stand religious crazery. Honestly, he'd be tipping his fedora if he had one.\c-
