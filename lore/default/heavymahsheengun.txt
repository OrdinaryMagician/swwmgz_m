How much bullet is too much bullet? The answer, according to **Cyrus Enterprises**, is "never enough". The **Sheen Heavy Machinegun** is a monstrosity in all aspects when it comes to delivering lead. Steadily feeding directly off **Hammerspaceâ„¢**, this puppy can be carried anywhere without the need to bring along hefty ammo boxes, ready to rain death upon anything on demand. Additionally, powered by **Tach-Engine**'s "Magdalene" Microfusion battery, the weapon can stay in operation for several days without needing to recharge.

The ammunition employed by this weapon are AP rounds of 14.5x114mm caliber. Unlike the standard heavy ordnance rounds used within the Russian Empire, these are far more potent, employing an alloy of both mundane and exotic elements known as Meta-Tellubrium, generally used for fusion reactor parts due to its outstanding resilience to both extreme pressure and heat. As reported following the **Ghoul Hunt** of 2007, this ammunition is quite effective in tearing through demon flesh as if it were jelly.

While generally meant for mounted use, on-the-go operation is possible, provided the user is equipped with silver-rated power armor at minimum in order to handle its heavy recoil.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- 1050 RPM operation. Sustained fire in this mode is theoretically endless, as the heat produced can be efficiently nullified by the internal cooling systems, it is therefore the recommended mode for most situations.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- 2100 RPM operation. Twice the amount of bullet, but with far more heat. Sustained fire in this mode may trigger the weapon's safety lock should the rising heat bring the weapon too close to non-operational temperature.

\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Toggles automated spin, to reduce downtime between bursts. Do note, however, that while this is active, the noise will alert enemies.

\cfReloading:\c- There is absolutely no need whatsoever to reload this weapon, as it feeds directly off Hammerspace, requiring only a large supply of ammunition. Hammerspace containers will automatically link all necessary rounds for tethered feeding.

\cfTechniques:\c- Both triggers can be held simultaneously, allowing for a hybrid two-shot mode, with three times the bullet barrage. The heat output of this mode is quite high, however, so it is not well recommended for extended use.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfHEAVY MAH-SHEEN GUN!!!\c-

\cfI don't care if Nerdboi made this, I don't care if this is a reference to what I can tell it is, I love it, it's good, perfect for my severe thirst for dakka, and I'm sure yours too. This thing FUCKS (and so do I).\c-

\cfBy the way I know what you may be thinking and no, they're not tracer rounds. As I was told, they're actually going so fast they literally catch on fire from air friction. Pretty hardcore, ain't it? Bet the UAC will never beat this shit.\c-

\cfGod just seeing it in action is enough to make me wet. Hell, more than that. The Sheen HMG is such a delicious festival of dakka that the mere sound of it firing makes me unleash Leviathan in my panties, and you can quote me on that.\c-
