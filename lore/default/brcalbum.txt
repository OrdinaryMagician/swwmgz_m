Released at the turn of the century, **Counter-Inquisition** is a collection of some of the most famous tracks of the British band **Black Rat's Coven**. A whole century of musical history, since the band's humble beginnings all the way back in 2006, condensed into a vinyl of pure **Ockophux**, a valuable metal from the **Anarukon** world that is said to ward off evil spirits.

\cfSide A:\c-
  1. Walpurgisnacht
  2. Blood Moon Cantata
  3. Army of Lust
  4. Your Dark Desire
  5. Red Star of Innocence
  6. Dragonheart
\cfSide B:\c-
  7. Black Rat's Coven (Medley)

Due to its commercial distribution in such a niche format, buyers also had access to a lossless quality digital download from the Black Rat's Coven website. In addition, the digital download also includes high resolution cover art, and exclusive video interviews with each of the band's four members, providing a retrospective look into their history together.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfGod... DAAAAAAAAAAMN...\c-

\cfThis is some REAL DAMN GOOD music, I tell ya. Ashley-san and the gang... Ever since Yu-chan got me into this stuff back in the day I've been hooked. And then the big thing happened, Yu-chan and Ashley-san met, and dated, and got married... And oh boy. Can't believe I'm tight with all the members of one of my favorite bands of all time (well, more or less).\c-

\cfDemo-chan, I swear, I don't understand how I'm this lucky.\c-

\cfUpdate: Remember my freakout when they played that song at our wedding? Red Star of Innocence? God I'm so fucking stupid. I just had a flashback immediately, remembering that one time I told Ashley-san I had no interest in meeting Kirin-kun (she made that song for his 12th birthday). Guess I have to eat my words now, huh?\c-
