The **Ragekit** is an experimental strengthening device for **Demolitionist** use. It is partially based on research material from the defunct **Decade Mechanics**, and allows for a boost to the unit's speed, resistance, and close combat ability.

Should be noted that while under its effects, the speed boost may make it hard to move around in tight spaces, as the unit will likely bump on every wall along the way. Additionally, as the force of impact is increased, it's possible to tear down doors or other obstacles when dashing.

Due to some rather unstable aspects of it, while its effects are active the unit may experience discomfort, and the desire to scream. This is perfectly safe, and it's been noted that the unit does not feel pain in any way, only anger.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfOK, so, I don't know what causes the screaming. It's a completely unintended side effect that I seriously can't figure out how to fix. Big sorry for that, Demo-chan. That's why this is classified as "experimental", I guess.\c-

\cfNow, I know you're worried about it, but trust me, it'll be fine. Even if you're going around bashing skulls while dropping F-bombs every half second, to me, you're still Demo-chan, my cute robutt.\c-

\cfThough... Kirin-kun does worry a whole lot about it. I've told him it's fine, that you're really not in pain or anything, but he really can't stand to watch the stream whenever you nab one of these. Poor guy...\c-

\cfHeh... still, he remarks on all the swearing, as if he's any better. I've heard all the stuff he shouts when he's mad at a game. Anarukonokxhaai swears sound so ridiculously violent, it's actually amusing af to hear all that come out of his mouth tho. Damn cutie...\c-
