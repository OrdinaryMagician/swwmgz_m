The **Wallbuster** is a beefy beast of a shotgun, sporting a total of 25 barrels divided into individually rotating groups of 5. It is chambered for 10Ga, making it even more ludicrous in its power and size. Not unexpected considering this has been commissioned by **Mr. BIG SHOT** himself. Of the many other weapons **Blackmann Arms** has made for him, this is the only one that was made public, and it's said that the others may be even more ludicrous.

The internal mechanisms driving this weapon have such a degree of complexity that they've been described as **"Kraut Deep Space Magic"** by some. Only **Hermann E. Ischer** himself knows every detail about their operation. With each twist of the main trigger, the topmost barrel is primed, and then its group spins counter-clockwise, with the next round ready for shooting. Every five shots, or when the secondary trigger is used, the main body spins afterwards, switching to another five-barrel group.

The Wallbuster is compatible with most standard types of ammunition, although there are safety restrictions on some, namely dragon's breath, flechettes, and golden shells. This limits the range of ammunition usable to only these four types: Buckshot, Slug, Saltshot, Lead Ball.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoots the barrel at the top.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Shoots the 5-barrel group at the top.

\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Shoots all barrels, if you really want to.

\cfReloading:\c- Once the side lever is pulled down, the barrel groups can be safely detached and reloaded individually. For reloading on the go, it's recommended to have a **Magnetic Utility Belt** or similar at hand, as it will make this operation easier. Speed loaders are available for purchase from the Blackmann Arms website, or from authorized distributors.

\cfTechniques:\c- True to its name, you can destroy all sorts of obstacles along the way, provided you're dealing enough damage relative to their size. This even includes locked doors, so you won't have to bother with key hunting anymore.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfOK so, this ballbusting hunk of metal. Yeah, now ain't that some good shit...\c-

\cfDon't worry about reloading this taking a long-ass time, btw. DemolitionOS comes with a quick reload routine that'll make it much easier for you. The ammo will be queued up in your Hammerspace, and then all you have to do is hold out your hand above the barrels, and they'll get deployed right inside. Nifty, huh? Taro did most of the work on that, so yeah, you can thank him.\c-

\cfOh and... y'know... this whole thing, that name and all, kinda makes me think of grandma a bit. I mean, if you change the first letter... Oh, do you hear those drums and that guitar? 'cause I sure do...\c-
