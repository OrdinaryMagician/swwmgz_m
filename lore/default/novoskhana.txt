The **Empire of Novoskhana** was founded in 45306 BC by **Eternal Empress Sythana Va Sarkha Daia Mykha Azanth Serei Yanikov I**. It is a tyrannical super-state spanning most of the habitable territory of the world it shares a name with, with an estimated population of 13 billion. Despite showing clear signs of physical and mental degradation, having lived for tens of thousands of years while still aging normally unlike the rest of her kin, the Eternal Empress has remained as its sole leader ever since its creation, with any and all potential successors being personally executed or exiled by her, and any who attempt an assassination being quite colorfully disemboweled by her in the process.

The societal structure of the empire is strictly matriarchal, all men exist only to serve their wives and provide them with children. In addition, most if not all women born in Novoskhana are raised for warfare, especially those of lower classes. Due to this fact, no one has dared to start any sort of war or conflict with the empire, as it is always at the ready to strike back, with its unstoppable armies of immortal warriors.

The Eternal Empress holds absolute power over all of Novoskhana, and is the one to make all important decisions, including the creation of new laws. Of all the various laws that have come from her, many have become so controversial that it has resulted in large groups of people "splitting off" from the empire to form their own separate nations. The Empress personally directs (and often herself performs) all executions of citizens that are deemed **"Deviants"**, a term used for all those who do not obey the empire's laws.

There are countless ways one could be labeled an "enemy of the state", among them, showing signs of "destabilizing the natural order of society", which includes but is not limited to: Men who reject marriage or having children, men who father another man as their first child, or are incapable of having any descendants, men who are witnessed maintaining relationships with other men, any individual who shares a name with the empress, any individual who "lives in disconnect from society" (usually used to refer to those who remain unemployed for extended periods of time, or who lack a home), women who do not contribute to war efforts, women who are seen maintaining relationships with other women, "divergent" individuals (term used for those that don't fall under the male/female binary), etc.

Two of the major bodies that split from the Empire are the **Kurenai Kingdom**, initially founded by the **Vexx Sisterhood** as a safe haven for enemies of the state, and the **Sykhai Empire**, an ironically named anarcho-communist collective founded by a branch of the Yanikov family that disagreed strongly with the "broken system" of the Empire. A large part of the free **Anarukon** population in the multiverse is contained in these two, while the rest have settled in various other places, including Earth.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfHoly shit, dude. If there ever was a contest for who's the most cartoonishly evil dictator in the history of the whole world, this fucker would get first place. Fucking... TERF empire. Wonderful, simply wonderful...\c-

\cfYeah, I would never want to even get fucking close to that place, holy fuck. I'd get my head yeeted clean off for pretty much ALL reasons or something, as soon as I set foot in there. What I really don't understand is... like... HOW IN THE FUCK are there still people in there??? WHO THE FUCK EVEN would want to live there at all???\c-

\cfOh, who am I kidding, of course there are people who'd be perfect with a shithole like that, there always are. If history has taught us anything, I mean... Yeah... Some people are shit enough to follow a leader like that, or worse...\c-
