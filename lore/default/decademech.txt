A large ruined facility found buried under the sands of the barren planet of **Sunkaeze**, within the farthest reaches of **Xathar**. It is the only structure ever found in there, and has been the subject of a lot of exploration and study. Though most of the creations of its former staff have been lost, some have managed to find completely untouched, still working artifacts of various kinds: cloaking devices, personal teleporters, powerful energy weapons, and many others. The cause of this facility falling into ruin is unknown, and according to certain reports, may be connected to the death of the one individual that has been found referenced in most of the retrieved blueprints and research documents, the mechanical demigod **Maester Mekes**.

Of the many products successfully retrieved, the **Biospark Carbine** is one of the most notable. It was devised as the "signature weapon of **Decade Mechanics**", and described as "a piercing lance of electricity capable of deep thought". No one has been able to reverse engineer this odd weapon. There are an estimated 30,000 units stored within the facility, and their distribution is currently controlled by **Tach-Engine Technologies**, its founder being the main discoverer of this weapon, who has shown interest in studying this weapon in more detail.

Furthermore, there are many rumors spread by explorers that the ruins are haunted. Some claim that there are "angels of death" roaming the decaying halls of the facility, taking the lives of those that get lost while exploring. There's also the theory that Sunkaeze was the homeworld of the long extinct Kuramoxedyn race, the ancestors of the Izuna people of Nedoshiaan, and that these so-called "angels" are their vengeful spirits.

\cfSpooky spirits in a ruined complex in a barren planet... This shit sounds like it came straight out of a movie. The old man seriously found a goldmine of technology in there, too. I've even benefitted from some of it myself, heh.\c-

Additional investigation eventually resulted in tracking down of a **Mekyon** woman by the name of **Matha Sai**, who worked directly under Maester Mekes as his most close associate. She provided more details on the nature of the incident that brought ruin to the facility, having happened around 2734 BC with the containment breach of an experimental psychic weapon. The so-called "angels of death" that scavengers reported are specifically that weapon. It's estimated that it'll take several years more for all of them to fully decay, allowing the facility to be rebuilt. However, without Maester Mekes, it may not be possible to return Decade Mechanics to its former glory. Apparently during these past ~4900 years Matha has been searching for an individual capable of retrieving the mechanical demigod's immortal soul in order to siphon it into a new body.

\cfUpdate: Interesting story, that. So yeah, demigods can die, BUT apparently their souls don't and can just get put in new bodies. That... I think that still counts as immortality, right?\c-
