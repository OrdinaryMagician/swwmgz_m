A simple keychain decorated with various charms, personally chosen by **Saya Miyamoto**. Safely attached to your **Utility Belt** so you don't lose them.

Do note that this physical keychain you have on yourself is unrelated to the **Keychain** tab of your **Demolitionist Menu**, which keeps a listing of keys and other important items stored into **Hammerspace**.
