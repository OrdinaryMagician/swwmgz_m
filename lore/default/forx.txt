Founded in 2029 by **Harold Forx**, this company is credited with singlehandedly rescuing England (now Southern Ireland) from its long fall into ruin after **Brexit** in 2020, the **Scottish Independence** in 2022 and their losses in the 2026 **Irish Reconquest** (which happened in retalation to their declaration of war on the island the year prior). Despite these mortal blows, **Forx Aeronautics**, having appeared seemingly out of nowhere, founded by a man who, only years prior had been spending his life scavenging around junkyards, managed to pull in enough cash to rescue the whole territory only mere months after its foundation.

Forx is currently the #1 supplier of propulsion engines for all types of aircraft, be it commercial jet planes, or even spaceships. Their dominance extends all across the eastern side of the Atlantic, as overseas, in America, the **UAC** still reigns supreme, with their own in-house technologies.

Apart from aircraft engines, Forx has also adapted their patented jet propulsion systems for other uses, such as in the **JetBurstâ„¢ Impulsor** series of jetpacks, being the first to be considered "truly portable", or in the **Rapid Jet Compensator** recoil dampening system for high caliber firearms, which permits the use of these weapons outside of heavy, unwieldy power armor.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah, yeah, the usual "rags to riches" story. Homeless orphan becomes a "self-made" millionaire through sheer effort and perseverance, yadda yadda. As if. Bet there's something else to this whole thing that he ain't telling anyone. There HAS to be. No one just up and becomes filthy rich out of the fucking blue like that unless they've got some contacts somewhere, I ain't buying that.\c-

\cfAlso, guy's an asshole, anyway. Like any rich bastard capitalist pig, honestly. Can you believe that the fucker once tried to mow down the orphanage he grew up in? But the thing is, he tried... but failed, and boy was that a sight to see.\c-

\cfAlright, so as it goes, the guy first tried to tell them to fuck off from there and let him bulldoze the whole place to build some shit in there. They didn't even listen. Then, he goes there in person, and THIS is the fun part. After an argument with the director of the orphanage, who personally knew the guy, he got SLAPPED SO FUCKING HARD he did a complete 180 and ran away crying.\c-

\cfI fucking kid you not, Demo-chan, that is exactly what I saw. I've watched the archived footage like a hundred times, since it helps me feel better when I'm in a sour mood, and... every time, the part where he gets fucking backhanded across the face by the old geezer, it never fails. I always lose my shit. It's TOO GOOD.\c-

\cfSeriously, this is what all those people really need. You don't know how many times I wish I could just go and beat the crap out of that bastard manchild Kelliher. I'd surely feel much better, yeah. Fuck him, and the UAC too. "Eat the rich" is somehow still relevant, but I really want to popularize "Beat the rich".\c-
