For as long as man was sapient, religion has always been there. Mankind has always wondered if there is one, or many supreme beings who created it all. The answer to this question may not be exactly what they expected. **Gods** are indeed very real, but they aren't exactly the almighty entities one would usually imagine.

There are countless individuals all over the known Universe and even beyond, who can be classified as "Gods". So many, in fact, that there is a high likelihood that any one person may have come across a god at least once in their lifetime, without realizing it, as in most cases, they are no different from us in appearance. Gods live among us, hidden in plain sight. Some may even decide to form families with mortals, and from this giving birth to **Demigods**, who inherit their agelessness, but not their complete immortality.

Humanity's first contact with an actual, physical deity had been initially thought to be that of **Uruk'Anth**, who arrived on Earth in late 2097, and claimed to be the **Abrahamic God** himself. It was however later found out that this was all a lie, and his deceit was part of his plan to take over the planet and its resources for himself. Following the destruction of the **SUSAN** rogue AI that he had devised, which additionally resulted in his own death, it was made very clear that he was, indeed, not a god at all. Rather, investigations of his cult, the **Faculty of Illuminated Nobodies**, revealed that his true identity was that of a member of an alien species known as the **Xevetha**, native to the remote world of **Urkai**, who dedicate themselves to acts of deception like these, in an attempt to obtain "artificial godhood".

Instead, the actual first contact had happened far, far sooner than anyone had known. Back in 2006, following the debut of the British band **The Black Rat's Coven**, people were introduced to one rather peculiar member of it, **Maruku Sarahabinaku**, a gigantic, yellow-skinned woman, who even introduced herself as "Goddess of Madness", something which was thought as really just some artistic title of sorts, rather than an actual fact. It wasn't until the previously mentioned incident that she was approached for further questioning and, indeed, confirmed that she was indeed a real god, unlike the man who had come to our planet. Furthermore, **Mykka Psyann**, another member of the band, also revealed herself to be a god. No one had even realized this, for many years.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah, mindblowing stuff, ain't it? First, there was the big reveal of aliens being very real, which sure fucking changed things around for everyone, then came this. Most were all "oh they're super powerful aliens" or some shit, really not even trying to believe in the possibility that maybe gods actually ARE real too.\c-

\cfCome the fuck on, with all the shit that's going on out there, you're really not going to believe someone's a god even if they get up in your face and say it? Well, there was that one exception, but still... seriously?\c-

\cfI've actually met those two, personally, y'know. My fave's Mykka-sama, she's real cool and fun to be around, and gives me candies whenever I visit. Then we spend the whole day together with her giving me these cool lore dumps about the "history of everything" and all that stuff. I don't really understand most of it but it's still amazing. Like, holy fuck, there's all sorts of things out there, the universe... no, the MULTIVERSE is real fucking huge and super complex and stuff, much more than we could ever imagine... Blows my fucking mind, every single time.\c-

In recent years, the world was shaken once more after the discovery of other entities that stand far above these gods: **Administrators**.

\cfUpdate: The stuff about the admins is in another article. That really was fucking wild, I swear. There's no way in hell I'll ever forget about what happened the day after my wedding with Kirin-kun, holy fuck...\c-
