The **Silver Bullet JET** is the 1.150 member of the **Silver Bullet** series of ultra-high caliber rifles manufactured by **Blackmann Arms**. It was created as a lighter, more "reasonable" alternative to the 1.350 **Behemoth** model. Weighing 43 kilograms and sporting a total length of 2.4 meters, it is sufficiently compact for non-augmented human use.

The main ammunition designed for this specific model is the 1.150 **XSB (eXplosive Super Burst)**. These beastly rounds are partially based on a NATO standard 30x113mm cartridge, and employ a low density **Explodium** shaped charge as propellant, allowing high velocity while still being safe for use. The bullets themselves are composed of a tungsten carbide core, snugly wrapped in an aluminum jacket, and decorated with a thin silver plating for aesthetic appearance (Silver Bullets are, indeed, NOT really made of silver). XSB rounds can penetrate several targets before eventually stopping, depending on their size, they may also do the same for thin walls.

The secondary ammunition is the 1.150 **FCB (Fat Chode Bomb)**. Personally named by the CEO of Blackmann Arms himself, FCBs are quite similar to the standard XSB ammunition, but instead the bullets are full of additional Explodium, which on impact, is released violently, propagating its deadly blast through solid surfaces. Due to the volatility of these bullets, the propellant employed is slightly less potent, which results in a diminished potential for target penetration, but the blast definitely compensates for this. The explosive charge is so powerful that it can break some walls to pieces.

In order to compensate for its massive recoil, the weapon redirects a part of the gasses from round ignition into a set of jet compensators designed by **Forx Aeronautics**. Although partially cooled in the process, it is still hot enough to cause some damage to users not wearing adequate protection.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoot the bullet. Any small targets hit by it are pretty much turned to paste. A second press after firing will chamber another round.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Tap to switch next reload between XSB and FCB ammunition, if available. Hold and then press primary fire to manually cock, allowing you to retrieve unfired rounds.

\cfReloading:\c- Reloads the weapon. Each magazine holds 5 rounds. An extra round can also be kept chambered.

\cfZoom:\c- Custom-tailored adjustable telescopic sight, up to 16x. Equipped with a soft foam covering to protect the user's face during scoped fire.

\cfTechniques:\c- When going prone to use the bipod, the recoil compensators will automatically disengage, resulting in increased firepower at the cost of less mobility.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfWhat was that quote again, "there is no kill like overkill"? Yeah, sounds about right for this thing.\c-

\cfThe fuck are you even supposed to hunt with it, wild tanks? I suppose... bigass beefy demons could also count, but you're going to just turn them all to fucking paste.\c-
