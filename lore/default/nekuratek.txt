**Nekuratek** was founded by **Zanata Nekuraku I** in 1744, initially under the name of **Nekuraku Rafana Sakosai (Nekuraku Arms Manufactory)**. It quickly became the main provider of weaponry for the **Yathai Empire**, which secured the Nekuraku family's position among the "high class" citizens of the Empire. With this new status, Zanata even managed to secure a position as provincial leader of Akai, one of the largest and richest in **Nahkami**. With this absolute dominion of that region, Nekuratek would extend itself with practically no limits, thus becoming the largest corporation on the planet.

Zanata remained at the head of the company until 1870, after a malfunction in Nekuratek's first **Nokorokinylum Fusion Reactor** prototype resulted in an explosion that took her life and those of several other workers. Following the suicide of Zanata's husband, and with their two children, **Dokuro** and **Nokoi**, showing no interest in the family business, the only potential successor that remained was her granddaughter, **Zanata II**.

Once in charge of Nekuratek, Zanata II began to diversify into other fields, such as robotics and information technology, and gradually cut down on the fabrication of weaponry. It was not clear at first, the reason for this sudden change in direction, but following the fall of the Yathai Empire, she eventually revealed her long time disdain for the tyrannical regime, and her wish to distance herself and her family from "being architects of death".

During the initial period of "deescalation", her son **Zanaveth I** had been in charge of the arms manufacturing division, and was responsible for the creation of **The Emperor's Wrath**, a low orbit weapon that would be used in the events of the **White Scar** incident. After having witnessed what his creation had done, he resigned from his position and spent several years in solitude. He never involved himself with the company ever since.

During the massive overhaul to the political and economic systems of the nation in the period of transition of 2104-2108, Nekuratek was one of the very first to reform itself into a publicly owned organization, with the Nekuraku family serving merely as "symbolic leaders". In 2128, Zanata II retired and left **Zanaveth II** in charge of the company.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfGreat people to work with (even back during their old "unchecked capitalism" phase), tbh. I didn't actually have much of a contact with the old "big boss", but Zana-sama was always there anyway, and it was real nice to talk to her, even about boring business stuff.\c-

\cfIt's really pretty cool that these people so openly embraced the right way to do thingsâ„¢. Though... it's sorta something very expected considering the shit that was happening at the time. I don't know how Zanata-sama even managed to do all that right under the noses of those bastards. She was sooooo obviously anti-empire you'd have to be fucking blind to not realize. And she did have a GOOD reason to be, too, losing family in the war and whatnot.\c-

\cfAnyway, because of the stupid "White Scar" everything went to shit, and we haven't really been in touch, so I hope they're all doing okay. God, I miss Zana-sama... Absolute cutie...\c-
