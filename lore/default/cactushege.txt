The **Hege Cactus** is a small potted cactus that's quite popular in Finland. It's said to have such a potent ability to absorb humidity that it can even make people thirsty around it. It's not clear how exactly this particular species of cactus came to be, some say that it simply appeared out of nowhere.

There's also rumors that it can make you develop a taste for furry erotica, although there's no solid proof of this and it's simply just that, rumors.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfI think it's kinda cute, in a way. Small, round, there in it's lil' pot. I should get one, maybe.\c-

\cfI'm not even concerned about those rumors. I don't even understand the stigma against furries, or why it became like this after so many years. The world's gone nuts, I tell ya.\c-
