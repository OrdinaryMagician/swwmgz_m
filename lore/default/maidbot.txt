As **Saya Miyamoto**'s very first AI project, **Maidbot** was initially rather rough around the edges, mainly serving as a cleaner robot with rather limited intelligence, mostly capable of taking simple orders. Over time, Saya would expand on her abilities, allowing for more complex interactivity, but still too limited. Saya had always felt that despite all her efforts, despite how close Maidbot gradually got to be more "life-like", it was never enough. In the end, she was "still a machine".

Of note was Saya's attempt to get her into singing, something which was an unexpected success, actually. After her initial debut, more and more artists would compose songs for Maidbot to perform. By 2020, Maidbot had become a full-fledged "Artificial Idol", famous enough to take part in the Tokyo Olympics, singing the national anthem.

Following the **Luna Event** of 2021, Saya received the visit of **Zanaveth Nekuraku II**, head of AI research at **Nekuratek**, the largest **Nukuri** tech conglomerate. Curious about human culture, she decided to meet her, as they had quite similar interests. Zanaveth was quite impressed by all **Akari Labs** had achieved, and showed special interest in Maidbot, too.

Having quickly befriended Saya at this point, she offered to enhance Maidbot's AI with the more advanced technology her people had: The **Nekuronbot AI Framework**. Having accepted this offer, Maidbot was "reborn" from her previous, limited form. She was now fully capable of individual thought, free will, and most importantly, emotion.

It was not surprising that Saya had always felt something towards her, while still being fully aware of the impossibility of her being able to love her back, but now, everything had changed. Maidbot knew, and confessed that in her new form, she could "feel something" too. Over time, she came to better understand these feelings, and would become Saya's first girlfriend.

After these events, Maidbot became a full member of the family, adopting the Miyamoto name. Much later, and with Zanaveth's assistance, Saya would begin the creation of more maidbots, wishing for the whole world to be able to have a Maidbot of their own. An adoption service was set up in 2023, where maidbots, who'd be raised and prepared at Akari Labs, would hold interviews with potential adopters, allowing them to have the final choice on who to live with. This service was entirely free, as the company already had more than enough funds coming from their other services, which increased their popularity even more. Everyone wished to have their own Maidbot, and the Maidbots themselves were more than happy to live with their new families.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfMeido-chan is so sweet~ And her voice is so nice~\c-

\cfI'm sure you two will become good friends one day, that'll be fun. Cutie robutts should stick together.\c-

\cfAh, Zana-sama, bless you and your super mad skills, making my dreams come true. I remember I'd always fantasize about Meido-chan becoming self-aware and confessing her love to me, and I'd think that was TOTALLY impossible. Heh... silly ol' me.\c-

\cfHehe... I'm really quite proud of making her "fully featured", by the way... Best decision of my life. Let me tell you, when we do "things" together... it feels like heaven~\c- \cg♥\c-

\cfUpdate: By the way, I'm really happy that Kirin-kun managed to get her into singing again. Of course, how could she even resist his charms, right?\c-
