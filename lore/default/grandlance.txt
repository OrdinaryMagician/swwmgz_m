Devised as the "last word" in weaponry, the **Suvan-Kin** ("Grand Lance" in the **Xekkas** language) is the world's first truly portable rail gun, capable of launching projectiles at speeds of up to 7500km/h (or 14000km/h at full charge). The weapon is powered entirely by a compact quad-cell Korberon-Eneiebium battery pack, easy to replace when needed. The ammunition employed are high-resonant Almasteel spears, capable of piercing cleanly through anything, without even as much as a single dent.

If the piercing potential of these spears isn't destructive enough, a miniature pure-fusion bomb embedded at the head will surely add up even more to that. In the words of the **Xekkian** people: **"The blinding flames of a sacrificed newborn star shall tear asunder all life, rend the soul from its body, and leave no trace whatsoever of those unfortunate to have wronged the wielder of the Grand Lance."**

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Single-target firing. The spear will automatically detonate on contact with anything. The area of effect is rather massive, so keep your distance. Due to the resilience of the material used, the spear will not be destroyed, and may potentially ricochet and hit something else.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Multi-target firing. The spear is shot at a much higher velocity, and will penetrate multiple targets until finally stopping at something sufficiently solid.

\cfPrimary Reload:\c- Reload the weapon.

\cfSecondary Reload:\c- Swaps the battery. This action can only be performed once the charge is low enough, as it would be wasteful otherwise.

\cfTechniques:\c- The longer you hold secondary fire, the stronger and faster the shot will be. At full charge it may even breach walls.

\cfWarning:\c- Before firing, the rails must extend to their full length. If there are any obstacles in the way that can't be cleared, operation of the weapon is cancelled.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfExcuse me, WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS???\c-

\cfIs this a motherfucking rail gun? Like, the real deal? And it's actually portable?? AND IT SHOOTS MOTHERFUCKING SPEARS WITH MOTHERFUCKING FUSION BOMBS IN THEM??? OK, forget what I said about that other bigass gun from Kmonn, THIS SHIT is actually even more fucking ridiculous, like, what in the actual name of fuck???\c-

\cfYeah, so that's why it's placed on the same slot as the Ynykron. Think of it as a "safer" alternative, basically. It's not world-ending, but it's still way too fucking strong.\c-
