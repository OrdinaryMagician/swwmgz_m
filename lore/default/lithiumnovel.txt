The first volume of an unfinished series, which surfaced in an undisclosed bookstore. As told by its manager, this graphic novel simply popped up there. They had no recollection of it ever been brought in, but it was there, vacuum sealed, in perfect condition. It tells the tale of an alternate world, much like our own, where a demonic invasion happens. Despite it having popped up in the early 21st century, some details were accurately similar to those of the 2148 invasion, although the story told deviates from it, into something far more grim.

No one knows who the author is, it's not mentioned anywhere in its pages. Nor on the cover, and the back is entirely blank except for a single, multicolored triangle. Nevertheless, many copies were made, and it became immensely popular, going as far as to receive several awards, being regarded as one of the greatest graphic novels of all time.

Fans hope that, one day, a second volume will appear, just as mysteriously as the first.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfGod... fucking... this thing is... just too good, I swear. You need to go sit down and give it a read one day, it's a life-changing experience. This is light years ahead of anything that's ever been written, in the history of mankind.\c-

\cfOK, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit, because I'm a huge fan, but come on. Seriously, give it a read after the mission, you'll love it, Demo-chan.\c-
