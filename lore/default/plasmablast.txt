Developed by **Nuutek** in their days of old, nowadays discontinued but still being produced by enthusiasts from its public blueprints, the **Plasma Blaster** was the very first plasma weapon of **Nukuri** manufacture, designed to replace common ballistic sidearms of that time. Releasing small discharges of ignited **Nokorokinylum**, it is capable of rapidly neutralizing any small target.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Rapid shots of scorching plasma. The projectiles will travel quite fast, but dissipate after a certain distance.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Charged shot. Hold and release. A slower, but much stronger and destructive projectile, especially if charged from a full cell. The gun has to be held with both hands, as the instability induced by internal plasma charge may make aiming far more difficult single-handed.

\cfReload:\c- Replace the ammo cell on the weapon. Each can power up to 15 shots.

\cfTechniques:\c- Obtaining a second Plasma Blaster allows switching to dual-wield mode. Secondary fire in this mode shoots the left hand gun.

Due to the high availability of the materials used, and a shared friendship between Nuutek and their former competitor **Nekuratek**, you have free access to a practically endless supply of ammunition for this weapon.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfY'know, if you feel like melting knees is cooler than exploding them, this one's a good option too. Heard there's a buncha crazy variants of this gun around, since it's open source and all. It's been turned into shotguns, rifles, even flamethrowers using Nokron plasma, whew.\c-

\cfAlso because of my very valuable friendship with Zana-sama, as you can see there we get free ammo for the thing. Fairly convenient, that. Wish it could be the case for your entire arsenal, but life ain't that easy.\c-
