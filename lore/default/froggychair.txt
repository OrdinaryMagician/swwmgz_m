\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfExcuse me what the fuck.\c-

\cfThose TWO certainly are behind this. I don't know how you did it, they said you only had to "spell the words" to summon it, but... yeah, there it is. It is quite literally what it says on the tin, and I hate the fact they know what this is and how much of a MASSIVE MEME it was back in my time.\c-

\cfSo, from what I know, this thing's indestructible and actually heavier than it looks, so you can probably bust some skulls with it. Also it squeaks, boy does it squeak. It's definitely not going to get annoying in the long run.\c-

\cfAnyway, I have to do this, I have to say it or they won't leave me alone:\c-

\cfWelcome to the \cfFroggy Gang\cf, Demo-chan.\c-
