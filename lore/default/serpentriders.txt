The **Serpent Riders** are a trio of demons originating from "the chaos beyond", as told in historical documents of the worlds they have dominated. It's said that they are only a few of an endless many outside these worlds, and their only desire is to bring chaos to it all. The three Riders are:

\cfD'Sparil:\c- The youngest of the three, a powerful sorcerer who claimed the land of **Parthoris**, and commands vast armies of undead and beastly creatures.

\cfKorax:\c- The middle "brother" of the three. We don't yet have enough information about him.

\cfEidolon:\c- The oldest and most powerful. No further information is available, either.

It is unclear if these demons have an actual connection to the **Hell** of our own universe, or if there are, perhaps, many different realms one could call "Hell" in each world across the vast multiverse. What is clear, however, is that they are a major threat to the peace of these worlds we have found, and must be eliminated.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah, I'm sure you can wipe out all these idiots without any issue. You've wiped the floor with thousands of 'em before, after all, so what threat could just three of them pose anyway? They have no idea of how strong you are (or of what you are, now that I think of it). These worlds hardly seem to stand at the same level of technological progress as us, they're more like... medieval-y dark fantasy sort of stuff? Yeah...\c-

\cfKorax:\c- The middle "brother" of the three. A hideous black beast, considerably stronger than D'Sparil, and known to employ a great deal of trickery in his evil deeds.

\cfEidolon:\c- The oldest and most powerful. No further information is available.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfLittle red riding hood back there was such an easy kill, I doubt someone "considerably stronger" would make much of a difference, don't you think? Besides, you're smart enough to not fall for anyone's tricks and traps, aren't ya. He doesn't stand a chance, huhu...\c-

\cfEidolon:\c- The oldest and most powerful. Defeated long after the other two, by an unidentified hero.

Despite the ultimate defeat of the three, it is unknown if more will appear one day, from the same hellish realm they came out of. But if these three were indeed the most powerful, it may just be that all that's left is mere fodder.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfI'm kinda left wondering who nailed the last guy. That could have been us, seriously. Missed opportunity there to finish the job we started, and someone went and stole our kill. Well, whatever, we're pretty much done with the worlds those bastards ruined.\c-
