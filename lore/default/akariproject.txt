\cfSynopsis:\c- In the year 2040, human science has evolved to levels never before seen. Mankind has explored not just their nearest planets, but those of neighboring suns too, and yet, there is more they wish, to go farther, to step beyond even the confines of their galaxy, and have every corner of the universe at the reach of their fingertips. It is then, that the greatest minds from all around the world are reunited, with one purpose, one mission: The Akari Project.

**The Akari Project** is **Saya Miyamoto**'s first foray into sci-fi novel writing, all the way back in 2021, when humanity had only just made its first alien contact through the **Luna Event**. It was advertised as a possible look into the future that the **Nukuri** alliance would provide, though nowadays it's seen more as an unfortunately "too optimistic" vision of said future. Nevertheless, its main premise still stands to become a reality, with Saya herself promising to spearhead a real Akari Project someday, for humanity to create its own gates into the farthest corners of the universe and beyond.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah... I was really dumb back then, thinking everything would turn out so well and all, but instead look at where we are, with humankind's first interdimensional travel experiments opening a goddamn portal to Hell of all places (fuck the UAC). And let's not get started on all those "advances" in science I fantasized about. Most of those are way far for us, even though all the others have them (or even better stuff). We're just lagging behind because of all the stupid shit people keep doing and all the work those capitalist trashlords do to set everything back (fuck 'em).\c-

\cfBut yeah, I totally want to make this real now, since I've got the know-how to do all this, mainly thanks to Zana-sama and her contacts. Well, I know the basics, at least, so I'll have to figure out the rest myself.\c-

\cf... And then it all came true, in a way. Good shit that I ended up making the Akari Project become real. Heh, the UAC got SOOOOOOOOOOOO fucking salty over this, it was absolutely delicious. The whole goddamn multiverse is open to us now, and it's all safe and free from pesky demon intervention (unless we use it to actually go to Hell, obviously).\c-

\cfOh this really is the good shit. I look back at the novel now and I'm left wondering if that romantic subplot will ever come true too. You know, when Doctor Kirishima meets Princess Ikana, and they fall in love and... *sigh* Just imagine, a cutie from another world joining us...\c-

\cfOh also, remember the romance subplot? Kirishima and Ikana, yeah... huuuuuge parallels with me and Kirin-kun there, just with the genders swapped. Didn't play out exactly the same way, tho, but it's all good shit.\c-

\cfI wonder if he'd enjoy reading this. Could be a good way to brush up on his English, too.\c-
