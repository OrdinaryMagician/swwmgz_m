The **Mykradvo (Vengeful Heart)**, also known as the **"Great Anomaly"** by some, is a magic artifact that releases tendrils of searing hot plasma onto any targets within 100 meters that bear ill will towards the person who crushes it in their hands.

A joint project between **Nukurines Mei Mess** and **Nekorosen Nerukousei**, initiated back when they served under the tyrant god **Nedoshiaan**, the Mykradvo is best described as the "ultimate panic button". Even long after their master's death, newer instances of this artifact would still be produced, as its usefulness in battle was seen to outweigh the concerns about the evil nature of its conception.

All newly created artifacts have only a fraction of the power of the original, retrieved together with other artifacts of the dead god during a **Devanikan** expedition to the ruined planet where Nedoshiaan's empire once stood. However, this is for the best, considering the dangers upon the world that would be unleashed should the original article be detonated.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfBig fuckoff orb of DIE. That's what this thing is. You give it a firm ol' squish and BOOM, everything around you dies. Definitely can see why people call it a panic button, yeah.\c-

\cfI remember one time I squeezed it by accident and it didn't do anything. I guess it's smart enough to not blow up if there's no one around who wants you dead. Handy.\c-
