The **X'Animen Coalition** is the name given to an alliance among various planetary systems, comprising several inhabited worlds, all connected through portals located on key planets. The coalition was first formed after the arrival of the **Knights of Ix** on these worlds, a group of seven ancient deities. They had searched through the vast universe, seeking inhabited planets, with the mission to connect them all together. For this purpose, one among them, **Ix Xeuriges**, constructed warp gates linking the various systems they'd come across, one by one. The knights then settled on each of these systems, watching over their people.

The central capital, **Zestal**, is located in the godly realm of **Kurain**, where overseer knight **Kennegenomk Ix** resides.

The current systems and planets that comprise the coalition are as follows:

\cxXathar:\c-
A system located within the Andromeda galaxy, and the most populated, despite only having four habitable planets.

\cfJunifh:\c- Closest to its parent star. A scorching hot planet, practically uninhabitable but with many underground communities. This is the planet chosen by **Ix Konro** as his home, and in it, he brought into existence the peculiar **Onkou** race, distinguished by being almost identical in appearance to him.

\cfTerasana:\c- A blooming oasis, and home to the **Sanais**, who once had visited Earth in the distant past, and were revered by the ancient Egyptians as gods. Although listed here, they are not members of the coalition.

\cfHebeku:\c- A warm, mountainous planet, somewhat akin to Earth, but with less water. This is the home of the **Votrexxian** race, almost once brought to the brink of extinction following a conflict with their immediate neighbors, the **Nukuri**, inhabiting the planet's lone moon of **Nahkami**. Hebeku also hosts a gate connecting to the human solar system, specifically, to the dwarf planet **Sedna**.

\cfKarnanaiahma:\c- A world of large oceans, and the homeworld of the **Qurensniv**, a race almost indistinguishable from humans. Some of its inhabitants fled to Earth in 130 BC, forming the town of **Kereshnovka**.

\cfBuran:\c- A formerly lush planet teeming with wildlife, which is now entirely covered by a matryoshka brain superstructure known as the **Bleaknet**. It is the homeworld of the **Burakan** race, of which only one surviving member remains: the lead engineer of the Bleaknet project. This oddly named structure in addition serves as a nexus of information for the entire coalition, linking together their various networks through complex space-time distortion technology.

\cfSora, Yasakuna, Sunkaeze:\c- Two gast giants and one barren planet in the outer rim of the system. All uninhabitable, although it's been noted that **Sunkaeze** once housed a facility owned by **Decade Mechanics**.

\cxZenna:\c-
The second most populated system, and with the most inhabited planetary bodies. It is located within the Triangulum galaxy.

\cfAdke:\c- A barren planet on the inner rim. Red, scorched, almost hellish in appearance. There are however some scattered mining outposts around it, as the planet is rich in **Almasteel**.

\cfDhetis:\c- The most racially diverse planet within the coalition (to an almost comedic level, by some accounts), host to the following: **Derkoi** (human-like, but characterized by having odd blackened beak-like noses), **Metlei** (elvish race characterized by a wide size range and their long, pointy noses), **Namaneku** (humanoids of small stature and frame, but of considerable strength, noticeable for their dark, beady eyes and sharp teeth), **Nekkesa** (similar in appearance to dark elves of fantasy works), **Nokretin** (almost indistinguishable from humans, except for the fact they all appear to have the same hairstyle: six "spikes" of hair), **Salman** (towering humanoid giants. all men are bald and have mustaches), **Sxjyanjn** (a species of human-shaped jelly/slime creatures, notable for having a language that's impossible to speak by anyone but themselves), **Odmorian** (yet another race with an elvish appearance, notable for their specific shiny dark brown skin and silvery white hair), **Rixa** (a race of dwarfish humanoids notable for the fact every single member of it is technically a king in their society), **Uvixa** (also known as **Neba**, a race of pint-sized humanoids), **Vik** (almost identical to humans, appearing even to be an exact imitation of caricature vikings). The ridiculous level of diversity in this planet, along with the notably odd characteristics of each, has been the subject of much study, often being cited as "the work of either a very bored or very creative god (or both)".

\cfIxxeney:\c- A large planet orbited by the fastest known moon. It is home to the **Xekkian**, fierce titan warriors, and the **Devanikan**, warriors of dragon blood, along with other lesser known races such as the **Fossiara**, **Wareyan**, **Assida** and **Rakity**.

\cfNekemekya:\c- A semi-artificial planet covered by a large metallic shell. It is home to **Ix Nemeke**, and the **Mekyon**, a race of mechanical beings he had created.

\cfXeryuga:\c- A highly hostile magma-filled hellscape planet, inhabited by the unfairly adorable bunny-like **Xeura** race, along with **Ix Xeuriges**, their creator.

\cfUrai, Erusa, Sethia:\c- A trio of gas giants rich in valuable materials. The exploitation of these resources is currently contested by members of the system.

\cfUnukugoshuenike:\c- A gigantic planet of glass and gemstone, and home of the **Goshun**, a race of semi-humanoid gemstone creatures. Due to their history of conflict, they are not part of the coalition.

\cfUnuenishe:\c- Former homeworld of the **Mishe** race, destroyed thousands of years ago during a war against the Goshun. The planet's artificial moon of **Deishe** serves as their new home.

\cxKryudon:\c-
The third most populated system in the coalition. Like Xathar, it is also located within Andromeda.

\cfKrako:\c- Barren planet rich in mineral resources.

\cfLok:\c- A dark planet shrouded in fog and rain. It is home to the **Lokan** and the **Rokana** races. Not part of the coalition.

\cfKayo:\c- An overpopulated city-planet, and homeworld of the **Kyon**. Also not part of the coalition.

\cfKantharo:\c- A small planet rich in fossil fuels. Home of the **Kanethe** and **Aldabura**, and also to **Ix Pyskou**.

\cfKruon:\c- Ash-covered volcanic planet. Home of the **Kruniin**, and ruled by **Dread Overlord Nuoma**.

\cfFurona, Sena:\c- Icy twin planets. Uninhabited.

\cxMondakan:\c-
This system is not located within the observable universe.

\cfSoya:\c- A molten rock that was once mistaken as a second sun.

\cfMon:\c- A planet with odd similarities to Earth. It is home to its namesake race, the **Mon**, plus many others. Also serves as home to **Ix Xekkene**.

\cfKuranite:\c- Rocky planet, home of various species, such as the **Forozen**, **Kuranit** and **Okonova**.

\cfNedoshiaan:\c- Formerly a member of the coalition before the protector god of the native **Izuna** race was driven mad, and then subsequently assassinated by his own followers, resulting in the planet being almost entirely destroyed.

\cfKumon:\c- A gas giant. Many of its moons have been conquered by the Mon.

\cxSumayon:\c-
A system from our own galaxy, used to house one lone planet, until a great cataclysm happened.

\cfSenekeye Keinukyenei Bhekeyuni:\c- Homeworld of the **Keinun** and former home of **Ix Sumai**. Was shattered to a thousand pieces and pushed out of its orbit after a great cataclysm.

In addition, two other systems were considered for joining in. Negotiations fell apart for one of them due to hostilities towards another member of the coalition, and another is currently pending, as its sole native species has several unresolved internal conflicts that have yet to be dealt with.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cf"Negotiations fell apart" is one way to put it. God, imagine... just IMAGINE for a moment that things had gone better. We would be part of a huge interplanetary alliance! That stuff is like... straight out of some sci-fi novel or something.\c-

\cfBy the way, I don't know if you've just skimmed through it or actually read the whole thing, but did you SEE the entry on that one planet? What the fuck is up with that??? It's like some crazy overly creative elementary schooler came up with all that shit. Fucking hell. Did a god really do that? Or... is it just the most ridiculous fucking coincidence imaginable...?\c-

\cfI don't even know, Demo-chan... at this point, anything could be, from what I've seen out there.\c-
