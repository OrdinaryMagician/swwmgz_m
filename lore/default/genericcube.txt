The **Perfectly Generic Cube** is an odd object that is perfectly cubic in shape and exactly 128mm across each side. They can sometimes be found in the most unexpected of places, and are well known as a popular collector's item among space travelers. Some suspect that these objects may be unimaginably old, and possibly remnants of a very ancient race, much older even than the highly revered **Mishe**, masters of arcane knowledge with countless aeons of history.

That was the theory, at least, until the two Mishe founders of the **University of Nos-Kora** were asked for any information on the artifacts. As was told, these are of divine origin, although knowledge of their true purpose has been lost. Nevertheless, they can work perfectly fine as "fancy paperweights".

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfOh, those things. Real fucking weird, they are. I recall one of Ibuki's girlfriends has it, that bounty hunter gal, Erika, yeah. She sometimes plays around with it whenever I visit.\c-

\cfThose things are like... uncomfortably perfect. It seriously makes me uneasy. What the hell were they even made for?\c-

\cfUpdate: OH MY GOD, I FINALLY KNOW. So let me just tell you what happened. I showed this thing to Mykka, y'know, big cute goddess of lore, to see if she knows what it is, and bam! Right away, I get an answer.\c-

\cfThese cubes are literally an universal safeguard for "something that no longer exists". It took me a while to process what that means exactly, but I'll explain. Apparently, there have been cases where pieces of history and reality had to be rewritten. Only gods retain memories of the previous timeline, but everyone else just forgets, and the thing is, this way some things that are forgotten and technically shouldn't exist anymore will stick around, but there has to be a way to "prevent" stuff from breaking apart, so this happens. They just turn into that. It's like... you know, when you install a mod in a game, and then you remove it, but there's stuff still in your save that can't be loaded anymore so they just turn into some random fallback thing. This is EXACTLY the same, and I don't like the implications here.\c-
