**Saya Miyamoto** was born in 1993 as the middle child of **Nana Miyamoto** and **Ryuji Miyamoto**, her older brother being **Taro Miyamoto**, born in 1985, and her younger sister being **Yui Miyamoto**, born in 2009. As a child, Saya already showed interest in science and technology, proudly looking up to her father and his inventions. She excelled greatly in school, having even been described as a "child prodigy". At the surprisingly early age of 13, having proven her outstanding abilities, she got herself into **MIT**, where she graduated in **Computer Science**.

In 2010, together with her brother Taro, the two founded **Akari Labs**, where her first project was an autonomous house-cleaning robot, which would later evolve into the modern **Maidbot**, one of the most popular creations of their company. She also would devise many other types of robots, all driven by rather complex in-house AI that she had personally designed together with her brother.

In 2018, Saya "ceased to age", due to the effects of the immortality she had inherited from her mother. She initially saw this as a blessing, allowing her to work on everything she ever wanted, without any time limits, but afterwards, remarked on the fact that she would forever be stuck with her current physique, being "short and flat", something she absolutely hated.

Saya would frequently be nicknamed **"Not-Tomoko"** around the net, in reference to a character from a popular manga series that people compared her with. It was noted that "in term of personality and looks, the resemblance is definitely there". Saya is well known for being quite blunt when talking to people, if she ever actually does so, as she's not very talkative in person. Online, however, she changes entirely, openly talking to anyone she comes across, casually shoving herself into random conversations, or extensively ranting about various topics, and debating fiercely with haters.

Saya is also known for being exaggeratedly flirty around attractive women, something which has resulted in many misunderstandings and awkward moments. She proudly states that she's "always horny on main", and never lets any chance to flirt with someone slip past her. She however remarks that this open flirting is "just a friendly thing, between friends".

Saya has many hobbies, including programming (her language of choice being **Haskell**), collecting videogames (most of which she doesn't actually play), drawing, 3d modeling and writing. Her fascination with anime and manga got her to write her very own: a three-volume series called **My Maid Is A Sex Robot**, partially based around her experiences with dating **Maidbot Miyamoto**. It became so popular it managed to get its own anime adaptation years later. Saya also wrote a science fiction novel, **The Akari Project**, a story about teleportation experiments and interdimensional travel "that doesn't go to shit like all the others". Following the disaster on the **UAC** bases in regards to teleportation, she announced that she wished to make the Akari Project real, "just to fuck those idiots over".

Currently, Saya has two girlfriends: Maidbot Miyamoto and **Ibuki Miyamoto**. Both of them being creations of her own, prompting people online to make incestuous remarks, which she frequently fights against.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYou like reading about me, don't you? I bet you do, silly. Alright, here's some more about me, just for you.\c-

\cfMy favorite color is red, favorite animal is the otter and favorite dish is pepperoni pizza. Got that? Good, let's keep going then. I like a lot of music, including Industrial, Metal, Drone, Dark Ambient, and I guess Baroque Metal since Ashley-san's band is so good. I absolutely ABSOLUTELY despise peppers, and eggs (though I can make an exception for meringue, that shit's delicious). I also hate skirts. Make me wear a skirt and I'll punch you. I prefer pants a million times more, though it's best if they're not skin-tight, that stuff's weird. I don't like clothes being stuck to me like that, egh, so yeah, if it's nice and baggy, that's excellent, good shit. Alright, what else? My favorite editor is vim, and uh, btw I use Arch, I guess. My top turn-ons are big tiddies, maids, femboys and heterochromia. My fav monster girl is the moth girl, and my waifu is Mashiro (specifically chapter 3 Mashiro, not the standard creepy yandere shotacon Mashiro, no thank you). Last thing: I may not shower very often, or use deodorant or anything, but I don't stink, I smell good, and people agree too, they say it's nice.\c-

\cfWell, are you satisfied, Demo-chan? Have I sated your thirst for Saya Facts™? Good, then you should go back to work.\c-
