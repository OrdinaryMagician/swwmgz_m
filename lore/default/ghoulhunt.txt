In the summer of 2007, there was an incident in the town of **Kereshnovka** where a high ranking **UAAF** officer was found dead, having been brutally murdered by one of the town's many ghouls. After this, a team was formed to hunt down and exterminate these dangerous creatures, thus marking the beginning of the **Ghoul Hunt**, which lasted for two whole years, spreading across the entirety of the town and its many surrounding areas. The hunters were very thorough, and ignored the natives' complaints of them being a "national treasure".

Coincidentally, sometime near the end of this hunt, an envoy of the **Kurenai Kingdom** was caught in the crossfire, while trying to seize one of the ghouls for unknown reasons. That envoy was none other than prince **Anthon Anderken**. Wounded, he retreated, not without first pointing at the hunters and screaming something, perhaps an announcement of future retaliation, as a couple days after the end of the hunt, during a routine teleportation experiment at the **Imanaki Corp** headquarters in the town, their systems were hijacked, and a vast army of **Anarukon** soldiers began invading the town, swiftly executing any humans they came across who could be identified as having any relation to the UAAF, which also included the entire staff of Imanaki, with the exception of CEO **Tetsuya Imanaki**, who was not present at the time.

The Anarukon remained on Kereshnovka for many days, until Anthon was eventually contacted by one of the locals, and convinced to remove his soldiers from the town, as there had been "enough bloodshed already".

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah, crazy stuff from back then, huh? People act like the demon invasion of the UAC was the very first, because THEY made sure this one was kept under wraps. Really does sound like the Anarukon alright, at least from what I know, of them having fucking unstoppable warriors and shit.\c-

\cfStill, what they did was kinda overkill. I mean, even if the guy got hurt, he was immortal and all and would just shrug it off, so no biggie, right? Unless there's something else I'm not quite seeing in all this... I don't know anyone with ties to the Kurenai Kingdom, so I really can't just ask, though. Damn shame.\c-

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfAlright so, after the wedding with Kirin-kun, we did meet the guy, Anthon. He was wearing an eyepatch and all, and apparently the wound is actually incurable??? What the fuck were those hunters using? I get now why this shit happened, at least. Well, that, and I also learned of the reason why he was there in the first place.\c-

\cfSee, this links back to your very first mission, Demo-chan. You know, the actual reason why Hell decided to go all murdery on us. Apparently Anthon had been sent there at the request of someone from Hell's royal family, to attempt to bring back a missing heir. THAT missing heir, the one that, had he not been fucking lost, would have prevented the whole uprising and demon invasion and shit.\c-

\cfYeah, so I hate the UAC even more now. They may have gone by a different name, but same shit. I hope those fucks get what they deserve.\c-
