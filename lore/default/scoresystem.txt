\cf Point-based Reward System\c-

The **Score System** allows you to accrue points for performing certain tasks during your mission, which can then be exchanged for rewards at the store in your **Demolitionist Menu**. Although being equivalent in assumed value as the **Yen**, it is not interchangeable with any actual currency, and therefore has no real value.

Points are earned through the suppression of hostiles (relative to their threat level), recovery of high value items, and discovery of hidden caches. Some additional rewards are also available for 100% completion of elimination, retrieval and discovery. Rapid elimination of hostiles, along with certain special conditions in doing so, may grant higher rewards.

Carried items may also be refunded for additional points, allowing you to exchange them for anything else you'd prefer instead. This process is automated when obtaining weapons you already possess, or reach the carry limit for certain items.

Please do note that there is an imposed limit of 999,999,999,999,999,999 points, which, in practice, shouldn't even be remotely reachable.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfAlright, I'll be honest here: This is more videogamey stuff from nerdboy. But I think it's good, in a way. There's something about the rush of seeing the numbers go up, you know, and you can get something nice out of it too. I can't exactly hide this from you but it's something we both agreed on, for your sake.\c-

\cfLook, putting you right into a war zone and telling you to kill monsters, I'm sure that it's going to be a stressful experience. But, just think of it like it's a game, and you're being rewarded for being good at it, racking up points and raising that high score. Sometimes you really need to dissociate from the horrible things that are happening around you. I know it's hard, and maybe it sounds fucked up. But really, I'm just worried, is all.\c-

\cfPlease stay safe out there, Demo-chan.\c-
