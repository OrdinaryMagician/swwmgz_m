One of the many devices from the ruined **Decade Mechanics** facility on **Sunkaeze**. Successfully reproduced by **Tach-Engine Technologies**, based on recovered blueprints. The so-called **Ghost Artifact**, once activated, generates a distortion bubble around the user that redirects outgoing photons, rendering them completely invisible. After its activation, there is no way to turn this off. Rather, one has to wait for its internal battery to fully drain.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYou may become invisible, but you know they'll still hear you, right? This thing might actually not be very useful considering how noisy that body of yours is (my bad). Well, actually, could be useful in SOME situations, I guess. Just... try to keep the noise down if you want to sneak past some baddies. Or... I don't know, strategically make noise on purpose to confuse them?\c-
