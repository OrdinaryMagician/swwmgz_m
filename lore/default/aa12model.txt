A relic of the past, or at least a replica model of it for collectors. It is not functional, but the attention to detail is outstanding.

Although originally not very well known, the AA-12 reached new heights in popularity following the acquisition of its design and manufacture rights by the now defunct US-based **Ninnacht Armaments**, after which it received various improvements, and even served as the basis for many other shotguns for years to come (including some by **Blackmann Arms**, who bought the company in 2018).

Lightweight, comfortable, and with a sleek and easily recognizable look, it is one weapon that has taken a place in the hearts of many a gun nut. It had even proven to survive the test of time, as shown by the **Red Oni** choosing it as one of her weapons during her time in **WW3** (and its grim aftermath).

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfIbuki seriously loves this thing. I could kinda blame it on me showing her a certain character from a certain game that uses it. She became obsessed, seriously. I hear that sometimes she even... with it... well, you get the idea. All these years and she still loves to take it down to the range and unload it, just... moaning in pleasure afterwards. God... it's kind of weird, but also hot af.\c-

\cfOh that also reminds me, one of these days I'm going to see if I can make a maidbot of her waifu. That'd be fun, although I doubt she'd feel and act the same, even if she looked the part.\c-
