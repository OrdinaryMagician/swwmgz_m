The **Manarock** (Adkana: Manarokou, lit.: "shielded heart fruit") is a fruit common within the **Uusnai** region of the divine realm of **Kurain**. Known for its fragrant scent and creamy, soft core, it's considered a delicacy among **Gods**. It is also well known that, if not properly and cleanly removed from its hard outer shell, it can become lethally poisonous, causing rapid death on lesser beings through spread of a very potent neurotoxin.

It rarely, if ever, has made any appearances in our own world. Some gods may bring them along, but they can only grow in the soil of the divine realm. One should be highly wary if a god offers you this fruit. Always be sure that they have peeled it properly for your consumption, as there is no known antidote, and the damage done by its toxins is irreversible.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cf*sigh* Maruku offered me one once. And like the dumb idiot I was I bit straight in, shell and all. Of course, I fucking died. Vomited my guts out in the process, mixed with tons of blood, too, which didn't make for a nice image. Ever since then, she always peels them first. They're really tasty when they don't kill you instantly. The taste... I don't know how to describe it, it's sweet, somewhat lemony, but like with all sourness removed, and it melts in the mouth. Feels like custard, kinda.\c-

\cfYou know, actually, this felt to me like the complete opposite of when I tried pufferfish. Like... I feel it's totally overrated. Maybe the risk of dying from it is what makes it so tasty for people, and being immortal just... takes that away from me? I don't know. Still, I'll take this insta-die fruit over it anytime.\c-
