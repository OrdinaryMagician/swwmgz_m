The **Psykkonovexx**, named after one of the **Nine Kings of Kurenai**, is one of the major instruments of modern **Anarukon** music composition, being especially popular for its deep, echoing metallic sound. Though there are no direct equivalents in the human world, some would agree that the most similar instrument to it would be the bagpipe, although this is considered a major stretch.

Among various artists of fame, one of the most prolific users of this instrument is the co-founder of the **Dark Reaches Project** band, prince heir **Ossid Anderken**. His mastery of the Psykkonovexx has allowed him to compose truly mesmerizing melodies, blending seamlessly into the dark and dreadful tone of the band's various synthetic compositions.

The instrument's operation is rather simple, being mostly managed through two modulation sliders and a simple set of pressure-sensitive buttons for mixing various base tones together, allowing for all sorts of convoluted harmonics. A truly skilled player can even twist these sounds into very distinctive "wails", which some have described as "the sound of a million chainsaws revving in perfect harmony".

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfCan I add that Anarukon music is absolutely fucking hardcore as all shit? No seriously, as someone who's all big into the "soothing sounds" of drone metal and dark ambient, I vibe hard with this. I wish I could have had this in my life sooner.

\cfGod, I even met that guy in person too, and the rest of the gang. So this Ossid guy, he's even shorter than me, you saw, but he's actually way older than he looks, dude's been doing this for thousands of years now. I would totally imagine that learning this instrument isn't something that a very normal and mortal human would have the time for. But maybe I could... Well, or not.\c-

\cfAlso holy shit his husband creeps me the hell out, with that whole thing of wanting to turn my aura into an instrument or some shit. I have no idea what that was all about.\c-

\cfAnyway, I'd suggest you not to play around with this thing in the field. You'd probably make so much noise you'd wake up all the monsters in the area.\c-
