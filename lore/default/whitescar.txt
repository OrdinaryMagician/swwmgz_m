In June of 2073, the **Nukuri Seventh World War** began. It was one more attempt by the **Nahkami Liberation Front** to put an end to the oppressive rule of the **Yathai Empire**, this time expected to be their final. When the news of this conflict reached Earth, **President Dick Richardson** of the **United States** made some rather noxious comments on social media directed at **Ledora Yathai**, head of the Nukuri empire. As expected, they were not very well received, and an escalation of insults ensued. Many Nukuri who had settled on Earth fled in protest, as the ball kept rolling. At its boiling point, the Nukuri emperor, fed up with all this, officially declared war on the United States, ready to launch a direct attack as "punishment for their insolent attitude". Ground units were deployed in September of 2074, and thus the war began.

There were many losses on both sides, including civilians, in a chaotic confrontation between people who, not long before, had been peacefully allied for half a century. In three years, the vastly superior Nukuri armies neutralized all opposition, and set their sights on the very heart of the country. Wishing to "slay the beast from within", a small team managed to locate and capture the president. He was given one last choice, right there and then. He could either surrender and publicly apologize for his affront to the empire, or he could refuse, and watch as the **Emperor's Wrath** falls down upon him.

He chose the latter option, and what followed was nothing short of unimaginably despicable and cruel. All Nukuri forces retreated, and they evacuated any remaining civilian Nukuri who still remained. Then, in an instant, a succession of blinding flashes of scorching light reduced the whole United States territory to ashes, coming from the experimental orbital weapon the empire had built many years prior. It was its very first test fire, and the actual scale and effects of it were not yet known. Some say that the apocalyptic effects it had were not truly intended, that the plan was not to put an end to all life, but rather only cause destruction on a more "technical" level, disabling all electronic devices and machinery. Suffice to say, when the lead designer of this weapon, **Zanaveth Nekuraku I**, saw what had happened, he suffered a severe mental breakdown, and disappeared from the public eye for many years.

With this attack, the flames of the war against the empire only got stronger. In addition, all the remaining Nukuri on Earth were forced to leave, and with the exception of a select few countries, the **White Scar Treaty** was signed almost unanimously, putting an end to half a century of Nukuri contributions to the evolution of our science and technology. Those who had signed had to reject anything made by them, and no longer make any contact with any member of their species. In addition, they were no longer allowed to remain on their Moon colony either, forcing the **Luna Research Institute** to close its doors after almost four thousand years.

Everyone wanted the emperor's head. Not only had it been a major mistake for humanity to have enraged him, but it had been an even bigger mistake from HIS part to have used that weapon. 30 years into the chaotic seventh war, a member of the Nekuraku family notified one very specific group of what had happened: The **University of Nos-Kora**. Serving as the embassy of the ancient **Mishe** race, the University had always stayed neutral to the various internal conflicts among the Nukuri, but this time, they stepped in. What the emperor had done, in the eyes of the founding **Nukritas Brothers**, was unforgivable. It was described by them as "the second most disappointing display of heartless destruction" they had ever witnessed.

**Nukritas 1xx** would then, by himself, walk all the way down from the northernmost region of Akane to the imperial capital in Vutaki. His advance could not be stopped, he shrugged off any attempts by imperial soldiers, he destroyed their weapons merely by looking at them. Once he reached the imperial palace, he kicked the doors open and made his way to the throne, there, emperor Ledora Yathai, frozen in terror, received a single punch across the gut from the Mishe ambassador, and was sent flying in a straight line out the window, reaching such a velocity that he completely vanished into the void of space. Then, the University made their announcement, the **Nos-Kora Ultimatum**. The Nukuri race was given eight years to resolve their conflicts and make peace. Should they have failed to do so, the University would close its doors forever, and the Mishe would formally leave the **X'Animen Coalition**, taking their valuable knowledge with them.

This threat was taken very seriously, as the Mishe were one of the most important members of this interplanetary alliance, and so a massive reform followed. Both sides were now united in their mission to rebuild Nahkami in its entirety as a new nation. In 2108, only halfway through the time limit they had set, the **Nukuri Unified Government** was finally established, with **Zanata Nekuraku II** as "transitional" prime minister. Following this, an attempt was made to reestablish relations with Earth, but it was useless, they were completely ignored, save for two countries who had not signed the treaty: Scotland and Japan.

These two countries were host to powerful corporations that had been long time partners of Zanata's own company, **Nekuratek**, and were fully aware of the truth of the situation, hence why they had refused to break bonds with them. Of note regarding this were various statements on social media from **Saya Miyamoto**, head of the Japanese **Akari Labs**, condemning all those who had signed the treaty for their "gross generalization" in seeing the entirety of the Nukuri as an enemy.

No further attempts have been made ever since to try once again to reestablish the former alliance, not even during many major events that would threaten Earth once again, where they would have gladly come to our aid as they had done in the **Luna Event** of 2021. Earth was, in addition, barred from the possibility of entering the X'Animen Coalition due to this fierce opposition.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfLo and behold, here it be, the darkest moment in human history (to date). Seriously, it fucks me up thinking again about what had happened, it was some awful shit. Like, not just the whole fucking burnination of an entire country, but also what was going down on the other side too, all the stuff Zana-sama told me about.\c-

\cfI mean, sure, from this one can guess that the Nukuri were anything but peaceful, but that's not even half of it. The empire, the fucking empire, it was all the goddamn stinking bitch-ass piece of shit empire. Fucking, megalomaniacal evil-ass genocidal shithead emperor running the show, doing whatever the fuck he wanted. All those wars, it was all people who wanted him gone, and he'd crush them, over and over, with no remorse. He ran the place, and he could do whatever he wanted to them, like the ugly bastard he was. Yeah, I heard all of it. The mass executions, going as far as to bringing not one, but TWO whole races to extinction, yeah, THAT was sure fucked up. Oh but what about, torturing and massacring people who were seen as "traitors" and "deviants", huh? Yeah, that shit too. Zana-sama lost a lot of her family because of that. Ugh, I swear, one day I'm going to nail down where that bastard was yeeted to, just so I can kick him into paste. I'll obviously start with the balls, for sure, that one's for the other thing he did, which I'm not going to talk about here because I mean, holy fuck, this got dark (and it gets even darker). I have GOOD reasons to hate someone as fucking disgustingly vile as this motherfucker, hell, "motherfucker" is not even close there, considering what he did. Yeah, I think you get the hint now, do you? I bet you'd want to get your hands on him too. God damn if only those crazy guys hadn't yeeted him into space...\c-
