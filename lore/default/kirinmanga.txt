\cfSynopsis:\c- When her family moved to the Ruby Empire, Alissa felt like a fish out of water. This was so much different to the rural lifestyle she was used to, everything was new and confusing, but then she met a handsome young boy, who happily helped her along. As the two grew closer, she would eventually be struck by the most unexpected of revelations: He was none other than the emperor of the land himself! Kind, caring, pure-hearted and innocent, he was a polar opposite of her, but despite their differences, the love they felt for each other would only grow stronger. One day, having been invited to the imperial palace, Alissa would bear witness to a side of the emperor he had never shown anyone before. And thus, her new life began.

An unexpected return to manga writing from **Saya Miyamoto**, co-lead of **Akari Labs**, yet again a romantic story sprinkled with her signature "wholesome and fun lewdness". Despite its short length, it has received much praise online, many wishing for a sequel, or a spin-off centered around the emperor's charismatic maid. Saya herself has made no promises, but has stated that both of these may be considered, someday.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfHeh, I wrote this in like three days. Drawing everything, however, took a whole week. Yeah, I'm not that good, I mean, even though I shamelessly trace over 3D models and all (that I make, at least).\c-

\cfIt's obvious what this is all based on. I mean come on, you'd have to be blind af not to realize. The first time we dressed Kirin-kun up just... gave me such a burst of inspiration that I HAD to write it all down. Oh it was just so adorable, wasn't it? Trying out all sorts of cute things on him... Obviously, we didn't take pics, that'd just be rude. But all of that is forever engraved in my mind (and yours).\c-
