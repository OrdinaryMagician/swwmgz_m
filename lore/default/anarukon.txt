The **Anarukon** are a race of immortal beings native to a parallel world known as **Novoskhana**, outside of the bounds of our own Universe. According to their historical records, this world was created by a deity known as **Noskas Kurenai** ("Great Father of Eternity" in their tongue), over 50,000 years ago. Novoskhana is also home to the largest empire ever documented, the **Eternal Undying Empire of Novoskhana**, with an estimated population of 13 billion, relatively sparse considering its actual physical size, as it covers most of the habitable land of this world.

Only part of the total Anarukon population live in Novoskhana, however. Following general displeasure with the empire's policies and controversial position regarding basic civil rights, various groups have seceded from it, one of the largest being the **Kurenai Kingdom**, initially led by none other than the deity himself, who, as it is told in many stories, decided to sacrifice his godhood in order to save his people from the tyranny of the **Eternal Empress**.

The Anarukon are known as fierce, unstoppable warriors, due to their rapid healing and total immortality, able even to put themselves back together after being decapitated. It is said that once the Empire has set its sights on the conquest of some land, the wisest choice is to immediately surrender, as fighting them will only result in the most painful of deaths, in a completely one-sided battle.

Many people of this race can be found on Earth, a fact that was mostly kept well hidden until humanity's first contact with other species following the **Luna Event** of 2021. Furthermore, other information later surfaced, concerning the involvement between the Kurenai Kingdom and **Imanaki Corp**, as the kingdom's armies were ultimately responsible for the destruction of their headquarters in **Kereshnovka** in 2009, the so-called **Hellbound incident** brought upon several weeks after the end of the **Ghoul hunt** of 2007. It's said that ever since that incident, the kingdom had declared humanity to be its enemy, but no attempts to retaliate beyond that specific incident were made afterwards.

Among the many members of this race inhabiting Earth, one name many would recognize would be that of **Ashley Knox**, lead singer and guitarist of **The Black Rat's Coven**. The reveal of not being actually human was received with much surprise, though it was not as spectacular as the fact that two other members of the band were literal gods.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah, really cool stuff about parallel worlds and gods and warriors and shit, ain't it? Stuff like this really makes me wish I could just like... travel all over the multiverse finding neat stuff and meeting cool people, you know. Maybe one day, who knows. All the shit that those fucking UAC idiots have done honestly made me rethink ever getting into interdimensional travel. Seriously, it's like every single damn old story about "opening a portal to hell" was just a prediction for that. Anyway, I'm getting a bit sidetracked. So, Ashley-san is one of them, that's neat and all, at least Yu-chan gets to have her own immortal girlfriend, huh. Same for Taro nii-san, having that damn prankster gremlin Ellen-san, also one of these people, of course. When the hell is it going to be my turn? I mean, not that I mind, I'm fine with having Maidbot and Ibuki around, and... I guess you too but... *sigh*, makes me damn jealous, you know.\c-

This cold hostility lasted until 2171, when **Saya Miyamoto** married **Kirin Xanai**, leader of their main ally, the **Sykhai Empire of Akkou**, and then befriended **Queen Andreki Anderken**, current lead of the Kurenai Kingdom.

\cfYou know what? I have to say it, I REALLY have to.\c-

\cg♥\c- \caI LOVE YOU KIRIN-KUN!\c- \cg♥\c-

\cfHuhu... seriously. Still can't believe that stuff actually happened. I wished and wished to get my own Anarukon cutie, just like Taro nii-san had Ellen and Yu-chan had Ashley, and bam! There it was. And of course I have to thank Ashley-san for the fucking ultimate blessing, too. Like, as soon as I tell her about the Akari Project she jumps and goes all "I know of a place you can visit", and yeah... that's how I met the cute boy. I already told you all this, but hell, I need to write it down here too, just as a reminder. Ain't he the cutest? I remember how much you and Meido were blushing when you first met him. That was so adorable, the sweetest thing, even more than those "milk breads" they had at our wedding banquet (good shit btw). And now the four of us are married to him, and life is good.\c-

\cfOh yeah, also meeting that girl, Andreki, that was the biggest embarrassment in my whole fucking life, I swear to fuck. Like, picture this, I'm told to wait up for someone who wants to have a talk with me in private, and... this... fucking... sassy lost child just approaches me, tiny girl, acting all high and mighty, saying stuff like "I am someone very important" and "you should know who I am, Lady Saya" and I'm like "sorry kid, I'm waiting for someone here, can't play with you", and then she fucking EXPLODES at me going all "HOW DARE YOU" and "I AM MUCH OLDER THAN YOU" and shit, and yeah... I went into full "thousand apologies" mode, just slamming onto the floor and everything. Kirin had to run up to us to explain things and get her to calm down because I was just... unable to do anything. Holy fuck, that... At least we got to be friends later, but... at the moment I felt like I had turned myself into the mortal enemy of a whole fucking kingdom.\c-
