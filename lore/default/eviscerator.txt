A beastly weapon devised by the one and only **Mr. BIG SHOT**, to "rain hot steaming metal" on large groups of enemies, turning them into a fine red mist in mere instants. It has been described as "the bastard child of a shotgun and a grenade launcher" by some.

Its ownership and use was banned on many countries, not only due to the gruesome effects it had on targets, but also the danger it posed even to its own user. However, at the start of the demonic invasion of 2148, the ban on this weapon was lifted, and was deemed justifiable for use against the invading forces.

Unlike other weapons of similar operation, the **Eviscerator** does not need to be reloaded, thanks to its compatibility with **Hammerspaceâ„¢** containers, allowing its internal magazine to refill as needed from the operator's own ammo supplies.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Detonates the shell directly, spreading hot steaming metal in front of the user.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Lobs the shell as a grenade, which will detonate on impact with any surface or object and release its payload in the direction it was facing when initially shot.

\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Toggle between two spread modes for the primary fire. Allowing for either a wide shot with more close range crowd coverage, or a tighter cone which can be beneficial for hitting targets at mid to long range. Toggling to an extended barrel also has the added benefit of increasing the range of the secondary fire.

\cfTechniques:\c- The metal fragments shot by this weapon will ricochet all over the place, which makes it very effective for shooting around corners and hitting targets out of sight, or hiding behind cover.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfWhy is there an "owo" face scribbled on every shell? Who did this? I want answers!\c-
